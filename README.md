I  used Laravel, jQuery (AJAX) & SCSS for the completion of this tech test. To run this locally, you can follow the steps below.
- composer install
- npm install
- npm run dev
- php artisan serve

Note, I learned from last time to include a unit test (Mockery), to run the unit test locally
- php vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit
